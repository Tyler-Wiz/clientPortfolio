            <p>Soon after the international deal with the UN circle of Diplomats Emilia and her team won a pitch with LG electronics to lunch their new phone variant LG G5. Emilia proposed a ground-breaking strategy to launch the device by shutting down 10 top news websites including Linda Ikeji, Bellanaija, Naijaloaded, YNaija amongst which for 5 minutes the websites would only display the device’s unveiling simultaneously with the launch party.  This was an idea that has never been thought of or implement in the history of digital marketing which generated massive buzz.
